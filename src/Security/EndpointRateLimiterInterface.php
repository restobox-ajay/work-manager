 * Stable core port for the reusable non-login endpoint rate limiter (forgot-password, magic-link,

 * auth-security-bundle ({@see \App\Bundle\AuthSecurity\Security\EndpointRateLimiter}); core controllers and
 * other feature bundles depend only on this interface so they never couple to the security bundle
 * (FEATURE-144 / ADR-044).
 *
 * Core defaults it to {@see NullEndpointRateLimiter} (never throttles when auth-security-bundle is absent).
 * The bundle's compiler pass re-aliases this interface to the real limiter when registered.
