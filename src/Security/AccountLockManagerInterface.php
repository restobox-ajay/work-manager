/**
 * Stable core port for the account-lockout state that CORE (non-feature) code needs to read and clear.
 * The lockout state used to live as a `locked_until` column on the `user` table; it now lives in the
 * auth-security-bundle satellite `account_lockouts` (FEATURE-144 / ADR-044). Consumers that must NOT
 * depend on the bundle read/clear it through this interface:
 *  - {@see \App\Security\UserChecker} enforces the lock on login;
 *  - {@see \App\Controller\AdminUserController} and {@see \App\Controller\Api\AdminApiUserController}
 *    let an admin manually UNLOCK an account, and the admin user list renders a "Locked" indicator /
 *    "Unlock" button;
 *  - the PAT bundle's TokenAuthenticator rejects a locked user's token.
 *
 * Core defaults it to {@see NullAccountLockManager} (nothing is ever locked when auth-security-bundle is
 * absent). The bundle's {@see \App\Bundle\AuthSecurity\Repository\AccountLockoutRepository} implements it
 * and the bundle compiler pass aliases this interface to it.
