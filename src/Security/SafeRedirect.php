/**
 * Sanitises a caller-influenced redirect target down to a same-origin LOCAL path.
 *
 * The post-2FA redirect target (FEATURE-131 / review C17) is derived from the request the
 * user was intercepted on. Storing an absolute URL there let a spoofed Host header (or a
 * crafted request URI) turn the post-2FA redirect into an off-origin one. This guard accepts
 * ONLY a path-absolute, same-origin target and otherwise returns a safe fallback:
 *
 *   - must be a non-empty string starting with a single "/"
 *   - must NOT be protocol-relative ("//host" — browsers treat it as absolute)
 *   - must NOT start with "/\" or "\" (backslash is normalised to "/" by browsers,
 *     so "/\evil.com" behaves like "//evil.com")
 *   - must NOT contain CR/LF (header-injection defence)
 *
 * There is intentionally no allow-list of routes: a local path under the app's own firewall
 * is same-origin by construction, which is all this guard needs to guarantee.
