 * session, or any secret: it is unguessable on its own, stored server-side only as a hash, and looked
 * up per request by the gateway (public/db-admin.php). That is what lets it expire and be revoked —
 * there is a row to delete — unlike a deterministic signed cookie, which is the same value forever.
 *
 * Kept as small pure functions so the mint controller and the standalone gateway share them: the
 * gateway runs OUTSIDE the Symfony kernel, so anything it needs must work without the container.
