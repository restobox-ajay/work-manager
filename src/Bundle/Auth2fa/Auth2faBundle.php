/**
 * auth-2fa-bundle — the USER two-factor (TOTP) feature packaged as an OPTIONAL Symfony bundle
 * (FEATURE-143, C36 Option A). The FIRST satellite-table extraction: it owns a NEW `two_factor_settings`
 * table (user_id FK) that replaces the old totp columns on `user`, and moves the user 2FA controller,
 * challenge listener, guard, trusted-device manager and its admin /config sub-page into itself.
 *
 * When it is NOT registered none of its services/routes/config sub-page exist (404-when-uninstalled),
 * its migration never runs (so two_factor_settings never exists), and core falls back to the null-object
 * bindings (App\Security\NullTwoFactorGuard + App\Security\NullUserTwoFactorManager). See ADR-043.
