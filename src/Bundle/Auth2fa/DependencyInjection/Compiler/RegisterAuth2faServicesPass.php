/**
 * When the bundle is registered, upgrade the two stable core ports from their null-object defaults
 * (defined in the app's config/services.yaml) to the real 2FA services (FEATURE-143 / ADR-043):
 *   - TwoFactorChallengeGuardInterface → TwoFactorGuard (AccountController's pre-2FA guard)
 *   - UserTwoFactorManagerInterface    → TwoFactorSettingsRepository (admin/user 2FA read + reset)
 *
 * This runs as a compiler pass rather than a services.php alias because the app's config/services.yaml
 * — which defines the null-object defaults — is loaded AFTER every bundle extension, so a bundle-level
 * alias would be clobbered by it. A compiler pass mutates the fully-merged container and wins.
