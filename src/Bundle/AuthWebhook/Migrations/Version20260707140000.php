/**
 * auth-webhook-bundle owns the `webhook_delivery` schema (FEATURE-141, migration-ownership pattern —
 * mirrors auth-magic-link-bundle's Version20260707130000). This migration lives under the bundle's own
 * migrations dir, registered via AuthWebhookExtension::prepend() ONLY when the bundle is enabled — so a
 * deploy without the bundle never runs it.
 *
 * It is GUARDED (create-if-not-exists): on the existing history the earlier app migration
 * (Version20260531000000) already created the table with the final shape, so this is a no-op there; on a
 * fresh DB where the app migration was removed and the bundle fully owns the table it recreates the exact
 * ORM-mapped shape (two named indexes). Idempotent and reversible.
