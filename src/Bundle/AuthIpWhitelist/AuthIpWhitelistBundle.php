/**
 * auth-ip-whitelist-bundle — the login IP-whitelist feature packaged as an OPTIONAL Symfony bundle
 * (FEATURE-146, C36 Option A). The FOURTH and FINAL satellite-table extraction: it owns a NEW
 * `user_ip_whitelist` table (user_id FK) that replaces the old `allowed_ips` column on `user`, and moves the
 * login IP-whitelist listener and its admin /config sub-page into itself.
 *
 * When it is NOT registered none of its services/config sub-page exist, its migration never runs (so
 * user_ip_whitelist never exists and allowed_ips is never dropped) and — the listener being gone — there is
 * NO IP restriction on login at all. Core falls back to the null-object binding
 * (App\Security\NullIpWhitelistManager), so no per-user override is ever stored or read. See ADR-046.
