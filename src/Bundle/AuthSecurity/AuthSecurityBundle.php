/**
 * auth-security-bundle — login rate-limiting + account lockout packaged as an OPTIONAL Symfony bundle
 * (FEATURE-144, C36 Option A). The SECOND satellite-table extraction: it owns a NEW `account_lockouts`
 * table (user_id FK) that replaces the old `locked_until` column on `user`, owns the DBAL rate-limit
 * stores (login_attempts, endpoint_rate_limits), and moves the login rate-limit listener, the endpoint
 * rate limiter, and its admin /config sub-page into itself.
 *
 * When it is NOT registered none of its services/config sub-page exist, its migration never runs (so
 * account_lockouts never exists and locked_until is never dropped) and core falls back to the null-object
 * bindings (App\Security\NullAccountLockManager + App\Security\NullEndpointRateLimiter) — so no login is
 * throttled and no account is ever locked. See ADR-044.
