 * Serialises whole Htaccess Lock changes across requests and processes (issue #44). Every change is a

 * .htaccess and the config rows — so two unserialised changes each started from the same snapshot and the last
 * writer silently won (a revoked IP came back; an added one was dropped), and their file and config writes could
 * interleave. The gate runs that whole sequence inside {@see synchronized()}.
 *
 * Its own lock file, NOT {@see HtaccessFile}'s: that one guards each single file write and is taken INSIDE this
 * section, and flock() on a second handle to the same file from the same process would wait on itself.
