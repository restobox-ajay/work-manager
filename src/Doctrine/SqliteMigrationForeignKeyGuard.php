/**
 * Runs migrations with SQLite foreign-key enforcement OFF (ADR-061).
 *
 * The connection baseline turns `foreign_keys` ON (ADR-056), which is right at runtime but dangerous during a
 * migration. SQLite cannot alter most columns in place, so Doctrine's generated SQL REBUILDS a table:
 * create a copy, `DROP TABLE` the original, rename the copy. With enforcement on, `DROP TABLE "user"` is an
 * implicit `DELETE FROM "user"`, which fires every child table's `ON DELETE CASCADE` — the satellite tables
 * (two_factor_settings, account_lockouts, password_meta, user_ip_whitelist) would silently lose every row.
 * Proven on SQLite 3.26.0 (production): rebuilding the parent with FKs ON left `lockouts=0 2fa=0`; OFF kept both.
 *
 * SQLite's documented procedure is: disable enforcement, run the rebuild, `PRAGMA foreign_key_check`,
 * re-enable. The pragma is a silent no-op inside a transaction, so this must run BEFORE migrations open one
 * (`onMigrationsMigrating` fires first in the default mode) — which is also why `--all-or-nothing`, where the
 * transaction is already open, is refused rather than allowed to quietly protect nothing.
