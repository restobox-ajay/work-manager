/**
 * The app's standard SQLite connection baseline (ADR-001: SQLite-only). Applied to every real
 * connection via DBAL's middleware mechanism (autoconfigured — DoctrineBundle tags any service
 * implementing `Middleware` as `doctrine.middleware`), so dev and prod get it exactly like every
 * other project, without relying on any one caller to remember it:
 *
 *   - `journal_mode = WAL` + `busy_timeout = 5000` — readers don't block writers and a brief
 *     writer overlap retries instead of failing outright ("database is locked").
 *   - `foreign_keys = ON` — SQLite ignores declared FOREIGN KEY constraints (including the
 *     satellite tables' `ON DELETE CASCADE`) unless this is set on every connection; it is not
 *     persisted in the database file.
 *   - `locking_mode = NORMAL` / `synchronous = FULL` — already SQLite's own defaults; set
 *     explicitly so the baseline is self-documenting and doesn't drift if that ever changes.
 *
 * The pragma list itself lives in {@see SqliteConnectionBaseline}, shared with the session handler's separate
 * PDO connection ({@see SqlitePdoFactory}), which this middleware cannot reach.
 *
 * Fails loud, not silent, for anything that connects but is NOT actually PDO SQLite: this app has
 * raw SQLite-specific DDL and DBAL-only tables throughout (migrations, `login_attempts`,
 * `endpoint_rate_limits`, session storage), so a MySQL/PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL` would otherwise
 * either fail confusingly deep in a migration or — worse — half-work with none of this baseline
 * applied. Better to refuse at the first connection, with a message that says exactly why.
