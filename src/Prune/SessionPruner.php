 * Prunes expired rows of the PdoSessionHandler `sessions` table itself (issue #30). Nothing else guarantees they
 * are ever deleted: the handler only deletes inside PHP's probabilistic session GC, whose probability is left to
 * php.ini — and Debian/Ubuntu ship session.gc_probability = 0 — so on such a host every visitor that ever started
 * a session (e.g. GET /login storing a CSRF token) left a row in the SQLite file forever (ADR-020: ephemeral rows
 * are flushed on a schedule).
 *
 * sess_lifetime is the ABSOLUTE expiry timestamp the handler writes (time() + ttl — issue #36), and the handler's
 * own GC uses the same predicate (`sess_lifetime < :time`). `sessions` is a DBAL-only table (not an entity), so
 * this is raw SQL.
