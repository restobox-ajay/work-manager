/**
 * A single prunable domain (one table). Each pruner owns its predicate ("what is prunable") and reads
 * its OWN retention from ConfigService internally; the shared app:prune harness (App\Command\PruneCommand)
 * owns the boring infrastructure (sorting, dry-run, per-pruner error isolation, one audit row).
 *
 * The `auth.pruner` autoconfigure tag is what lets PruneCommand collect every contributor via
 * #[AutowireIterator] — the same extension pattern as ConfigPageProviderInterface / ConfigPageRegistry.
 * A bundle pruner is autoconfigured (hence tagged) ONLY when its bundle is registered, so modularity
 * falls out for free: no services.php or compiler-pass edits, and the pruner simply disappears from
 * app:prune when the bundle is uninstalled (FEATURE-147 / ADR-048).
