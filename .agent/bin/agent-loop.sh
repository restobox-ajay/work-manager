Final verification failed after all features were marked passing.

Fix the failure honestly:
- If the test is valid, fix the application code.
- If the test is invalid, correct the test without weakening real coverage.
- Do not skip tests.
- Do not delete failing tests.
- Do not fake success.
- Keep the fix focused.

Select exactly one feature where passes is not true and dependencies are satisfied.

Rewrite .agent/SCRATCHPAD.md for this selected feature.

Then implement that feature completely.

Required workflow:
1. Identify the feature ID and acceptance criteria.
2. Add or update tests first where practical.
3. Implement the smallest complete solution that satisfies the acceptance criteria.
4. Do not mark the feature passes=true yet.
5. Do not update claude-progress.txt yet.
6. Do not skip, delete, weaken, or fake tests.
7. Do not touch production config or live services.

Stop after one feature or one coherent vertical slice.
