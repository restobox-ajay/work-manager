## OQ-007: Pre-existing ledger drift — FEATURE-106 cites a non-existent test method (blocks verify-fast)
**Discovered 2026-07-06 during FEATURE-126.** `bin/verify-fast.sh` (PHPUnit step) fails on
`tests/Unit/Meta/LedgerEvidenceAuditTest::testEveryCitedTestMethodResolvesOrIsDocumentedAsRemoved`:
FEATURE-106's evidence (AC2 happy path) cites `testAdminCreateWritesExactlyOneAuditRow()`, which
does not exist — `tests/Functional/AuditLog/AuditFlushFootgunTest.php` only defines
`testLoggingDoesNotCommitUnrelatedDirtyEntity`, `testBusinessRollbackLeavesNoSuccessAuditRow`, and
`testLoginFailureStillWritesAuditRow`. This is a pre-existing citation drift left by the FEATURE-106
round (the workspace was already RED before FEATURE-126), NOT caused by the admin-2FA work.
**Assumed resolution:** the FEATURE-106 owner (or a FEATURE-127-style ledger-reconciliation pass)
re-cites the missing method to the real test name(s), or drops the stale citation with an AC note.
Deliberately left untouched here to keep FEATURE-126 scoped to one feature.

**RESOLVED (FEATURE-103 completion, 2026-07-06):** FEATURE-106's AC2-happy-path evidence citation
was corrected from the non-existent `testAdminCreateWritesExactlyOneAuditRow()` to the real
`tests/Functional/AuditLog/AuditLogTest.php::testAdminUserCreateCreatesAuditLogEntry`, which makes
the identical assertion (`assertSame(1, countAuditEntries('admin.user_create','success'))` after
POST /admin/users/new). No code, no test-coverage change — a pure one-line ledger reconciliation
(the assertion always existed under the correct method name). `LedgerEvidenceAuditTest` now passes
and `bin/verify-fast.sh` is unqualified-green. Done as part of FEATURE-103's DoD because that
feature had reached the passes=true point where verify-fast-green (AC7) is the blocking gate.


## OQ-001: Superadmin Provisioning Mechanism
The spec does not specify how the first superadmin account is created (no existing admin can bootstrap it).
**Assumed resolution:** Provide a `bin/console app:create-superadmin` command. Record in DECISIONS.md.
answer: create through command line. at production with a fixed, but hard to get random password.

## OQ-002: "Unrecognized Device" Definition for Login Notifications
The spec says "email user on new login from unrecognized IP or device" but does not define what constitutes a recognized device.
**Assumed resolution:** A device fingerprint is SHA-256(ip + user_agent). A login is "recognized" if the same fingerprint has been seen before in LoginHistory for that user. Record in DECISIONS.md.

answer: configurable. IP only, browser cookie only or both

## OQ-003: Audit Log Retention Cleanup Trigger
The spec says the retention period is configurable but does not specify how old entries are pruned (scheduled command, middleware, manual).
**Assumed resolution:** A console command `app:audit-log:prune` performs cleanup. Operators schedule it via cron. Record in DECISIONS.md.

answer: configurable by default 90 days, configurable in that config page

## OQ-004: Admin Password Reset Flow
The spec describes a self-service password reset for users. It is unclear whether admins also have a self-service reset or are only managed by superadmins.
**Assumed resolution:** Admins do not have a self-service password reset form. A superadmin can reset an admin's password via the admin panel. A superadmin cannot be locked out — provisioning is done via console only.

answer: admins also self serve pw reset

## OQ-005: Session–User Association with PdoSessionHandler
When listing active sessions, the sessions table stores serialized PHP session data. Associating a session row to a specific user requires deserializing or tagging sessions at write time.
**Assumed resolution:** On login success, store a `user_sessions` cross-reference table (session_id, user_id, user_type, ip, user_agent, created_at, last_active_at). This table is the source for "view active sessions" and "logout everywhere". Sessions table remains Symfony-managed; the cross-reference is managed by a LoginSuccessListener and RequestListener.

answer : Yes
reminder: admin and user is completely separated entities so these tables are separate

## OQ-006: Separate Domain Testing (ADMIN_DOMAIN / APP_DOMAIN)
The spec says admin and user interfaces can optionally be served from separate domains via .env config. It is unclear whether tests should cover domain routing.
**Assumed resolution:** Domain routing is infrastructure-level config, not tested in the application test suite. Document in README. Caddy config handles the routing.

answer: the test suite will see what domains is in .env for tesitng.

**Resolved (FEATURE-091, 2026-06-21):** Separate-domain mode is now wired (firewall `host:`
matchers + unified `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` cookie knob, default off; see ADR-019). Domain
routing IS exercised by the application test suite — SeparateDomainModeTest reads the domains
from env and overrides them to prove both single-domain (no regression) and separate-domain
firewall/cookie behavior. Proxy still owns real cross-host routing.

## OQ-007: Should the pending impersonation request and the impersonation banners follow ADR-063's binding rule?
Found by the FEATURE-154 reviewer sweep (2026-10-01); neither waives 2FA, so neither blocked that fix.
1. `_impersonation_request` (`ImpersonationAuthenticator`) is a one-shot payload that signs the session in as a user
   with no credentials. When it is consumed, nothing re-checks that the admin-realm principal still matches its
   `adminEmail` or still holds ROLE_ADMIN. The window is narrow (admin logout and `AdminSessionRequestListener`
   invalidate the whole session), but it is a session attribute that grants access without being bound to the current
   principal.
2. `templates/base.html.twig` shows the impersonation banners when `_impersonating_as` / `_impersonating_admin_as` are
   merely present. After signing in as someone else in the same session, the banner wrongly says "Impersonating: B"
   while the session is C (C is now correctly challenged; this is display only).
**Assumed resolution:** none yet. Proposal: verify the admin token matches `adminEmail` (and ROLE_ADMIN) before
`ImpersonationAuthenticator` authenticates, and show each banner only when its flag equals the signed-in identifier.
