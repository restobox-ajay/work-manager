/**
 * FEATURE-139 — ADR tripwire (advisory runner).
 *
 * Prints human-review flags for ADRs in .agent/DECISIONS.md that are untagged, verifiable-but-
 * name-no-test, or that name a test/repo path which does not exist. This is DELIBERATELY advisory:
 * it ALWAYS exits 0 and never gates the build. Per FEATURE-139 AC5 the teeth come from ADRs carrying
 * tests (enforced by tests/Functional/Meta/AdrTripwireTest.php), not from a script that opines.
 *
 * Surfaced by bin/verify-fast.sh as an informational step. Run standalone with:
 *   php bin/adr-tripwire.php
