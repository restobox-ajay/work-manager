# Reset the shared test SQLite database to a KNOWN CLEAN, fully-migrated state.
#
# Both .env.test (PHPUnit) and .env.acceptance (the Codeception live server) point
# DATABASE_URL at var/test.db, so the two suites share one file. The acceptance
# DatabaseHelper resets before each of its own tests but never after the suite, so the
# LAST acceptance test's rows — crucially any GLOBAL `config` values written via
# seedConfig() — survive the run. The PHPUnit functional tests only clean the specific
# config keys they each know about, so an unrelated leftover global config row silently
# changes behaviour and fails the next run (the ~6err+30fail Acceptance->Functional
# pollution described in FEATURE-137). Deleting the file (WAL is enabled, so the -wal /
# -shm side files can carry state too) and re-migrating an empty DB gives a deterministic,
# pristine, zero-row schema. Running migrations on the now-empty file is trivially
# idempotent. Called before EACH suite so every suite starts from the same clean state,
# making the whole gate repeatable regardless of what a prior suite/run left behind.
