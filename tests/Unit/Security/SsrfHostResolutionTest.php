/**
 * FEATURE-128 (review C39): adversarial test for the SSRF guard's layered defence against a
 * hostname target that would reach an internal address.
 *
 * `localhost.localdomain` is the canonical loopback alias on many distros (127.0.0.1 / ::1). It is
 * now refused at the NAME layer — `.localdomain` is a special-use internal TLD — so the guard never
 * even resolves it (closes the "block localhost / localdomain" gap). Before that hardening the host
 * passed the public-FQDN gate and was caught only by the second, DNS-resolution layer, which relied
 * on the environment actually mapping the name to a loopback address.
 *
 * This test pins BOTH layers:
 *  - the name gate refuses the host outright (deterministic, no DNS), and
 *  - defence-in-depth: whenever the host DOES resolve, every resolved address is a blocked one, so
 *    even if the name gate were bypassed the resolution layer would still refuse delivery.
