/**
 * Guards FEATURE-137 AC3: "the migration step is idempotent on a populated test.db".
 *
 * The verify gate (bin/verify-fast.sh) runs `doctrine:migrations:migrate` before each
 * suite. That step is only safe if, on an already-migrated database, migrate is a no-op
 * that exits 0 (rather than re-applying DDL and erroring on existing tables). This test
 * runs the real command against the suite's test DB — which is already at the latest
 * version by the time PHPUnit runs — and asserts it reports up-to-date and exits cleanly.
 *
 * It goes RED if a future migration stops being a safe no-op on an up-to-date DB, which
 * is precisely the class of change that would reintroduce a non-repeatable gate.
